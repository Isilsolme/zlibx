// Pending-URI download writer.
//
// On Android 10+ the download engines can stream bytes directly into a
// MediaStore entry created with IS_PENDING=1, instead of staging the
// book in the app-specific dir and copying it into Downloads/zlibx
// afterwards (saves one full-file copy and the staging space).
//
// This class owns that entry: it buffers chunks, hands them to the
// platform in 1 MB batches (append mode, so a retry must resume from
// exactly the committed byte count), and persists a small JSON sidecar
// (`<savePath>.pending.json`) so an interrupted download — user retry
// or app kill — resumes the same pending entry.
//
// Throughput (item-5 speed fix): the network stream is never paused
// for a disk write. [add] only queues a full batch and returns; the
// batches are written strictly in order by a background chain, and the
// download loop is only held back when it runs more than
// [_maxBatchesAhead] batches ahead of the disk. The Kotlin side keeps
// ONE append stream open per entry for the whole download. Overall
// speed is therefore min(network, MediaStore write) — the same overlap
// the old `.part` IOSink gave — instead of network + write in series.
//
// The ResumableDownloader `.meta` validator sidecar is untouched: it
// lives next to the same `.part` path and is removed by [discard] /
// [finish] like a completed staged download would.
//
// Resume safety (B1): the sidecar can lag the entry — if the process
// dies after a chunk was committed but before the sidecar was written,
// resuming from the stale sidecar offset would duplicate bytes. So
// [resume] reconciles against the entry's true size (queried from the
// platform) and treats that as authoritative.
